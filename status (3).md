Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far i have managed to connect tmodloader to visual studio community 2019 and implamented microsoft NET framework along side microsoft XNA framework. With the setup being complete I have managed to import a modded sword in the game alongside changed damage values 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I would still like to try to change the basic model of the sword 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

So far none but I did find it tedious to actually have tmodloader set up correctly with visual studio community 2019.
