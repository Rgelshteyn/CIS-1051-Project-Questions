# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mod for Terraria 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I would like to create a mod that creates a cool and unique weapon 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

my mod will utilize tmodloader which allows user to create their own mods. tmodloader allows integration with visual studio code which is very welcome since I already have some backround experience with. through tmodloder I would like to make a new weapon that frankly will be op as I want to make the damage values really high. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good simple outcome for me would be for the weapon to simply aprear in game whether the damage values change or not. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If i succeed with that I would also look into possibly chaning the way the weapon can pottentily look like in game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

a possible best outcome for this is that I can add a potentiall uniquee effect that the weapon can do other then just being able to swing it around 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

the next steps will be to get myself familiar to how tmodloader works and how to eventually upload my work into the steamworkshop so it can be public for all. some new skill that will probably be needed is a better knoweledge of file management and placing the values into the correct spots so that the mod can acutally work. I will also need to learn how to change the weapon appearence and add new affects.
